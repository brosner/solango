Django Solr Documentation
=========================

Introduction
============
The purpose of this project is to allow developers to quickly integrate Solr search with any Django application. 
It was originally built for a top 20 newspaper site on Django .91 and has been upgraded to function with Django 1.0. 
During that process I broke a lot of things, but also made it a lot enhancements. We've tried to document the code 
to the best of our ability, outlining features and :ref:`things <fixme>` that could be improved. Don't expect perfection. 
Expect a great starting point that needs to be improved and nurtured. 

We are always looking for ways to improve this project, so log issues in the `Google Code Project <http://code.google.com/p/django-solr-search/issues/list>`_, 
find us on the #django irc channel nicks `screeley` and `jdolan` or send me email.
