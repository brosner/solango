Highlighting
============

Solr allows you to highlight text that matches the query the user requested. By default this 
feature is enabled via the initial settings::

    #Default Highlighting Settings. See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/HighlightingParameters
    # for more options
    SEARCH_HL_PARAMS = [
        ("hl", "true"),      # basic highlighting
        ("hl.fl", "text"),   # What field to highlight
    ]
    
See the :ref:`query <code-query>` documentation for more information.

When the results are passed back to the :ref:`Search Results <code-search_results>` it parses the 
highlighting xml and appends it to the document and the field. Here is how to access it::

    >>> from solango import connection
    
    # get a document
    >>> document = connection.select(q='django').documents[0]
    
    # Will join all the highlight values and put them on the highlight
    # attr on the document
    >>> document.highlight

    # If you want the highlighting for an individual field you can
    # access that too.
    >>> document.fields['text'].highlight

    # We found it nice if there was no highlight value returned in
    # the results to pass a truncated value instead
    >>> document.fields['text'].highlighting()
