Just a running list of things that suck. Feel free to add your own.

* settings. Sucks that you have to manually copy all the settings from inital_settings.py into the 
  root settings file. Has to be an easier way. 

* more robust import process. Right now it looks like this::
    
    for a in settings.INSTALLED_APPS:
    try:
        """
        This will call all the fun things in the search documents
        """
        module = __import__(a + '.search', {}, {}, [''])
    except ImportError, e:
        pass
        
   That sucks. Look at: django.contrib.admin.sites.register
