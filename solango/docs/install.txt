Installation
============

Source
======
There are no stable releases at this point, so just grab the source from Google code::

	svn checkout https://django-solr-search.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-solr-search 

This includes the example project and docs, if you just want the `solango` module use:: 

	svn checkout https://django-solr-search.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/solango solango
	
As with any module make sure you place it somewhere on your python path or in your app. 

Solango
=======
Why not name it search or solr or input your suggestion dumbass? Search is out because of 
the way that `solango` imports the search documents and Solr didn't seem right. Djolr was 
also on the list, but that didn't sound as cool. So, suck it up and embrace `solango`.

Settings
========
You will need to add `solango` to your installed apps.::
	
    INSTALLED_APPS = {
	    ...
	    'solango',
	    ...
    }

`solango` comes with a few default settings that it needs to run. Copy all the contents of 
`solango.initial_settings` into the root project `settings.py` file. More information is a
available in the :ref:`settings <code-settings>` documentation.

 
Solr
====
The backbone. Download it from here: http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/solr/. That's all you really need right now.
The :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>` will get it up and running.
