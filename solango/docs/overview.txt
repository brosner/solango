How it got Started
===================
This project has been in the works for awhile now. It started out with the original code written 
by Jay Dolan for a top 20 newspaper site. Readers where complaining that they were never able to find 
relevant content and they weren't given the tools to narrow down their search. With some of our 
past experiences with Solr it seemed like the obvious choice for this type of enterprise search concept.


What Django Solr gives you
==========================
Enterprise ready search that is easy to integrate, but also provides hooks for customization. Solr indexes 
are built using documents, in order to give the developer the maximum amount of flexibility we abstracted 
that concept into a SearchDocument. This allows us to do some very cool things, i.e. generate config files, 
facet and highlight to name a few. 

pySolr
======
There is currently an Open Source project out there called `pySolr <http://code.google.com/p/pysolr/>`_. 
It's a great lightweight binding for Python and Solr, but doesn't handle Solr niceties like faceting and
highlighting. If you think that this project is too heavy for your needs I would recommend checking it out.


Refactor
========
Originally it took custom code in the transform class in order to add a new model. This was the major point
of refactor, and where the SearchDocument document came about. I fully admit that parts of the code is very 
ugly, but without some feedback it's hard to improve.

Reuse
=====
You will notice if you poke around the code that we borrow from Django all over the place. Specifically, 
the SearchDocument is a combination of The admin and forms code. We tried to follow pep-8 with respect to
consistency.


Documentation
=============
I tried my best to document the hell out of this thing. It's all here, please let us know if something
isn't right.
